Note: Use the modified discord library to avoid antibot detection.

Make an environment variable named "token" and put your token there.

If you don't have config.json file, don't worry, use the ConfigGen.py to generate a config file according to your need.

Things to note:

1) To use cover image in the rich presence, create a new application at https://discord.com/developers/applications (Name doesn't matter here) Put the image you like and copy the application ID by scrolling down the page.

2) If you have placed the modified discord library folder in the same directory but it says that it is missing, uninstall the original discord library.

3) Make sure to install the requirements by "pip install -r requirements.txt"
