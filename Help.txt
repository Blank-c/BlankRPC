The name field contains the title of your game, it can be anything and must be enclosed within double quotes.
        
The type can contain the following numbers (only one of them at a time):
        
        0 - Playing status
        1 - Streaming status
        2 - Listening status
        3 - Watching status
        5 - Competing status
        
The application_id contains the ID of application made in your account. How do you get it? Well, here is the answer: 
        
1) Go to "https://discord.com/developers/applications".
2) Click on "New Application".
3) Name it anything.
4) The "APP ICON" is the image that will be shown in your playing status. Upload any image from your device to it if you want any image to be shown.
5) Press the save button.
6) Scroll down and copy the "Application ID".
7) Replace the 123456 in this file with the ID of your application (or it will not work).
        
Now what about start timestamp? Just place the current unix timestamp in it (Search for it on google). It should be an integer, not decimal.
        
state - Anything enclosed within double quotes.

details - Anything enclosed within double quotes.
        
size - Array of (current players in party, party size). If state is null then the size will not be shown in the RPC.
        
NOTE: You can put null in value of state, details, size, start if you don't want them.
